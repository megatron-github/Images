# Images
An introduction to Turtle in Python  The program will load a picture from a file and draws it using a turtle. The program can return a new image in which every pixel is a shade of gray equal to the average, a new image in which every pixel is the photographic negative of the original pixel (a dark component becomes a light component, and vice versa), and a new image in which every pixel is the average of itself and its neighbors (every pixel has up to 8 neighbors).
